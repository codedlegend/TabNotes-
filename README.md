# TabNotes-
My folders for the development of Tabnotes extensions

This is my first ever published chrome extension project, available on chrome webstore and microsoft edge. Have you ever gone back to a website forgetting what you wanted to do originally yesterday or from days ago? because I have experienced it many times and its frustrating, annoying and unproductive, thats why I made this extension to combat that problem, it allows you to save notes on each tab that so that you can return and remember what you originally wanted to do.
